# Conch Sage User Guide

Welcome to **Conch Sage**, your CLI-based AI research assistant. This guide outlines how different types of users can leverage Conch Sage to reason, write, research, and learn effectively using hierarchical, semantic conversations.

---

## Getting Started

Launch the interactive CLI:
```
conch-sage
```

You'll be presented with a prompt:
```
chatcli> 
```

From here, you can start new topics, reply, view the tree, ask smart questions, and manage files.

## Roles & Responsibilities

Conch Sage is your assistant ‚Äî you steer the conversation, it supports with memory, context, and retrieval.

### You (the user):
- Drive the questions and goals
- Promote meaningful insights
- Interpret results, validate facts
- Tag and organize when needed

### Conch Sage (the tool):
- Tracks structure and citations
- Embeds and retrieves semantically
- Formats smart prompts and logs context
- Persists and visualizes your thought process

| `reply <text>`           | Reply to current node, creating a child              |
| `view`                   | View current node prompt and response                |
| `tree`                   | Show the full DAG/tree of your conversation          |
| `goto <node_id>`         | Jump to a different node                             |
| `smart_ask <question>`   | Ask an LLM question using semantic RAG context       |
| `promote_smart_ask`      | Save the smart_ask as a new node                     |
| `embed_node`             | Embed the current node for semantic search           |
| `simsearch <keywords>`   | Search embedded nodes by similarity                  |
| `import_doc <path>`      | Import a markdown or RST document                    |
| `export_to_file <file>`  | Export current graph (nodes + smart_ask)             |

## Personas & Example Workflows

### üë®‚Äçüíº Researcher
**Goal**: Build structured arguments, synthesize sources

```
new What are the main challenges in scheduling DSLs?
reply How does Halide solve locality?
reply How is Tiramisu different?
smart_ask Compare Halide and Tiramisu
promote_smart_ask
add_citation from latest node to related findings
```

### üë©‚Äçüéì Learner
**Goal**: Learn interactively and semantically

```
new Explain diffusion models
reply What is classifier-free guidance?
import_doc stable_diffusion.md
smart_ask How is CFG implemented in the model?
view
tree
tag current as diffusion, basics
```

### üßë‚Äçüíº Engineer
**Goal**: Explore and refine a system design

```
new Design a GPU async kernel abstraction
reply What is warp specialization?
import_doc design_notes.rst
embed_all
simsearch kernel
subtree_summary
```

### üßë‚Äçüìà Debugging Detective
**Goal**: Investigate technical failures systematically

```
new Investigate model slowdown
reply Check dataloader bottlenecks
reply Look at GPU kernel logs
smart_ask Any reasons GPU scheduling stalls?
promote_smart_ask
show-citations
```

## File Management

- Save session: `export_to_file design-thread.json`
- Resume: `import_from_file design-thread.json`
- Git-integrated version tracking is automatically supported.

---

## Next Steps

- Try `help` in the CLI for a full command list.
- Use `tree` and `goto` to navigate the DAG structure.
- Explore `smart_thread`, `reuse`, and `subtree_summary` for deeper automation.
