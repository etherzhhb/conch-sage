# 📜 Conch Sage: Internal Design Summary

## 🚀 Project Scope

**Conch Sage** is a CLI-based, personal-use AI research assistant that models conversations as a **hierarchical directed acyclic graph (DAG)**. It supports:

* Deep, branching discussions
* Semantic citation and referencing
* Smart prompts with RAG-style context injection
* Version tracking, file diffing, and doc import/export
* Embedding-based search and tagging

---

## ✅ High-Level System Overview

### 🧠 Core Architecture

* CLI shell using `cmd.Cmd` + `prompt_toolkit`
* DAG graph engine: nodes (prompt/response/summaries), edges (hierarchy + citation)
* Persistent storage with `self._path`, no global state
* Provider-agnostic embedding support (OpenAI, Bedrock)
* FAISS-based simsearch backend

### 🔧 Key Features

* Conversation structure: `new`, `reply`, `view`, `tree`, `goto`
* Smart workflows: `smart_ask`, `promote_smart_ask`, `smart_cite`
* Document features: `import_doc`, subtree summary, git versioning, inline diff
* Embedding: `embed_node`, `embed_subtree`, `embed_summary`, `embed_all`, `simsearch`
* Web search: `mock_websearch`, `save_web_result`, `citeurl`, `smart_ask` with RAG
* Autocomplete, history, `fzf` search, fuzzy node targeting

### 🧪 Testing & DevOps

* `pytest`-based unit tests with mocks, CLI output captured via `capsys`
* Edge cases for file I/O, smart ask, citation handling, etc.
* GitHub Actions integrated for PR/test CI
* Codecov integration planned

---

## 🔄 Refactor & Internal Improvements

* Eliminated global `DATA_PATH`, `SAVE_DIR`
* Unified persistence with `_save()` / `_load(path)` using new format:
  ```json
  {
    "nodes": {...},
    "last_smart_ask": {...}
  }
  ```
* New methods: `export_to_file()`, `import_from_file()`
* Better test support via `tmp_path`, `tempfile`, custom `storage_path`

## 🔹 Example CLI Sessions

### New Node and Reply
```bash
chatcli> new What is loop fusion?
New node: a1b2c3d4

chatcli> reply It combines loops to improve cache locality.
Replied with node: e5f6g7h8

chatcli> view
[e5f6g7h8] It combines loops to improve cache locality.
```

### Embedding and Semantic Search
```bash
chatcli> embed_node
[Embedding] Using openai (mock)
Embedded node e5f6g7h8

chatcli> simsearch fusion
Results:
e5f6g7h8  0.89  It combines loops to improve cache locality.
```

### Smart Ask and Promote
```bash
chatcli> smart_ask What are loop transformations?
Smart response: Loop interchange, unrolling, fusion, and tiling optimize nested loops.

chatcli> promote_smart_ask
Promoted to new node: z9y8x7w6
```

## 🔍 Roadmap

- [ ] `smart_thread`: automate smart-ask → promote → cite
- [ ] CLI discoverability: `describe-node`, `show-tags`, `show-citations`
- [ ] Prompt templating via Jinja2
- [ ] Improved node targeting via fuzzy matching
- [ ] Graph export with filters, SVG/HTML
- [ ] PyPI packaging (optional)

---

## 🔍 Citation Edge Semantics

- `add_citation(from_node_id, to_node_id)` creates a **directed edge**: 
  - from_node references to_node

- Edges are stored as `from_node['citations']`
- Used to build RAG context
- Triggers optional `auto_embed` on the citing node only

---

## 📃 Summary

**Conch Sage** is a reproducible, structured CLI environment for LLM-driven research workflows:
- DAG memory structure
- Embedding + search
- Smart prompting with traceable context
- File/document support with versioning

It is built to be personal, modular, testable, and extensible.
